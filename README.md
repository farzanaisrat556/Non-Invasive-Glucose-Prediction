# Blood Glucose Level Regression for Smartphone by Combining Demographic Data with PPG Signals Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to develop a blood glucose level regression model for smartphones by combining demographic data with photoplethysmography (PPG) signals using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide a convenient and non-invasive method for estimating blood glucose levels, leveraging the capabilities of smartphones and the relationship between demographic factors and PPG signals.

## Features
- Data collection: The project involves collecting demographic data and PPG signals from participants using smartphone sensors.
- Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, perform feature extraction, and merge the demographic and PPG data.
- Regression modeling: Machine learning techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression are used for dimensionality reduction and regression modeling.
- Performance evaluation: The accuracy and effectiveness of the regression model in predicting blood glucose levels are evaluated using appropriate metrics.


## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of demographic data and PPG signals collected from a sample of participants. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset is not publicly available. However, a sample dataset can be generated using synthetic data for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Results
The regression model trained on the combined demographic and PPG data shows promising results in estimating blood glucose levels. Performance metrics such as Root mean squared error (RMSE) and Standard error prediction (SEP) are used to evaluate the accuracy and predictive power of the model.
